## ONP 

ONP [One Nigh Project] is a series of simple projects I develop for my own entertainment. 
According to its name each of those projects should not take more than just few hours of implementation.

## Mould

Basically it's an idea inspired by old-school DOS virus - LICHEN - which displays a nice effect on the screen. I just wanted to reproduce it using js and html canvas. At the same time I decided to use electron.atom.io to see how it works.
